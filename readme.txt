Currently we are using our local network to deploy smartcontracts for faster transactions.
If you want to deploy this smart contract into testnet please truffle config. And update network id in html/js/web3.setup.js.
Contract account will be FRS/RBI, using that account will create/publish money. And need to save your user id in settings.

Please let us know any issue.
